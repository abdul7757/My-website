    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #009688;">How do Hackers Try to Do Ransom?</h1>
    <p>Hackers attempt to carry out ransomware attacks through various methods, but the primary objective is to gain unauthorized access to a system or network, encrypt important files or data, and then demand payment (usually in cryptocurrency) from the victim to provide the decryption key. Here's a general overview of how hackers typically execute ransomware attacks:</p>
    
    <div class="attack-method">
        <h3>Phishing Emails</h3>
        <p>One common method is through phishing emails. Attackers send emails that appear to be from legitimate sources, often containing malicious links or attachments. When users click on these links or download attachments, it installs the ransomware onto their system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="attack-method">
        <h3>Exploiting Vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>Hackers exploit vulnerabilities in software or operating systems to gain access to systems or networks. They often target systems that haven't been updated with the latest security patches, making them more susceptible to exploitation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="attack-method">
        <h3>Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Attacks</h3>
        <p>Attackers may exploit weak or default credentials for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections to gain access to systems. Once inside, they can deploy ransomware across the network.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="attack-method">
        <h3>Social Engineering</h3>
        <p>Sometimes hackers use social engineering techniques to trick employees or users into providing access credentials or other sensitive information, which they then use to access systems and deploy ransomware.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="attack-method">
        <h3>Brute Force Attacks</h3>
        <p>Hackers use automated tools to repeatedly guess usernames and passwords until they gain access to a system or network. Once inside, they deploy ransomware.</p>
