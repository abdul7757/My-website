    <p>Ransomware on Android is a type of malicious software specifically designed to target Android mobile devices. Similar to ransomware targeting computers, Android ransomware encrypts the files or locks the device, preventing the user from accessing their data or using their device until a ransom is paid. Here's how Android ransomware typically works:</p>

    <h2 class="infection">Infection:</h2>
    <p>Android ransomware can infect devices through various means, including malicious apps downloaded from third-party app stores, phishing links, or even legitimate-looking apps that have been compromised.</p>

    <h2 class="encryption">Encryption or Locking:</h2>
    <p>Once installed on the device, the ransomware may encrypt the files stored on the device's storage or lock the device entirely, preventing the user from accessing their data or using their device.</p>

    <h2 class="ransom-demand">Ransom Demand:</h2>
    <p>After encrypting or locking the device, the ransomware displays a message demanding payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for providing the decryption key or unlocking the device. The message often includes instructions on how to pay the ransom.</p>

    <h2 class="threats">Threats:</h2>
    <p>In some cases, Android ransomware may also threaten the user with consequences such as permanent data loss or the dissemination of sensitive information if the ransom is not paid within a certain timeframe.</p>

    <h2 class="payment">Payment:</h2>
    <p>If the victim decides to pay the ransom, they are instructed on how to do so, typically through cryptocurrency transactions. However, there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will result in the decryption key or device unlock code being provided.</p>
