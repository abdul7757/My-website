    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #009688;">The Impact of Ransomware</h1>
    <p>Ransomware attacks can have significant and wide-ranging impacts, affecting individuals, businesses, and entire communities. Here are some of the key impacts:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li class="financial-loss"><strong>Financial Loss:</strong> Ransomware attacks can result in direct financial losses due to the ransom payment demanded by the attackers. Additionally, businesses may suffer indirect financial losses due to downtime, loss of productivity, and the cost of restoring systems and data.</li>
        <li class="data-loss"><strong>Data Loss or Theft:</strong> Ransomware attacks often involve the encryption or theft of sensitive data. If the victim does not have backups or refuses to pay the ransom, they may permanently lose access to their data or have it leaked or sold by the attackers.</li>
        <li class="operational-disruption"><strong>Operational Disruption:</strong> Ransomware attacks can disrupt normal business operations by locking access to critical systems and data. This can result in downtime, loss of revenue, and damage to the organization's reputation.</li>
        <li class="reputation-damage"><strong>Reputation Damage:</strong> Organizations that fall victim to ransomware attacks may suffer reputational damage due to the loss of customer trust and confidence. This can have long-term consequences for their business relationships and market standing.</li>
    </ul>
