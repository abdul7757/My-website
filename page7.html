    <h3>1. Install Antivirus Software</h3>
    <p>Antivirus software can detect and remove ransomware from your device.</p>

        <li><a href="#">Bitdefender Mobile Security</a> - Provides on-demand and on-install scanning, anti-theft features, app lock, and web security.</li>
        <li><a href="#">Norton Mobile Security</a> - Includes antivirus, anti-malware, and anti-phishing features, as well as app scanning and privacy protection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Install an antivirus app from a reputable provider and keep it updated regularly to stay protected against the latest threats.</p>
</div>

<div class="tip">
    <h3>2. Keep Software Up-to-Date</h3>
    <p>Regularly update your device's operating system and apps to patch security vulnerabilities.</p>
    <p>Go to Settings > About phone > Software update to check for updates.</p>
    <p>Enable automatic updates for added convenience and security. Additionally, consider enabling automatic app updates from the Google Play Store.</p>
</div>

<div class="tip">
    <h3>3. Avoid Suspicious Links and Downloads</h3>
    <p>Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading files from unknown sources.</p>
    <p>Only download apps from the official Google Play Store to reduce the risk of malware. Avoid sideloading apps from third-party sources unless absolutely necessary.</p>
    <p>Use a secure browser with built-in protection against malicious websites. Look out for HTTPS encryption and verify website URLs before entering sensitive information.</p>
</div>

<div class="tip">
    <h3>4. Back Up Important Data</h3>
    <p>Regularly back up your data to a secure location to prevent loss in case of a ransomware attack.</p>
    <p>Use cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive for convenient and secure backups. Ensure that automatic backup features are enabled for important data such as photos, videos, and documents.</p>
    <p>Consider using a dedicated backup app for additional control and customization. Test your backups periodically to ensure their integrity and accessibility.</p>
