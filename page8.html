    <p>A spoofed URL is a fraudulent link that is masked to look like a legitimate source in order to steal your data.</p>

    <div class="spoofing-method">
        <h3>4 MAIN WAYS OF URL Spoofing</h3>
        <p><strong>1. Misspelled links:</strong> People tend to skim read messages, which means hackers can send phishing emails with links that look just like trusted ones. It is enough to just change 1 character to register a new domain.</p>
        <p><strong>2. URL Shorteners:</strong> Another common way to spoof URLs is by using URL shorteners like bit.ly. However, they also make it easier for scammers to hide malicious links.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Links behind buttons or words:</strong> Hackers may send phishing emails pretending to be a trusted source and hyperlink malicious links to buttons or words. This trick is still used today, but it's relatively easy to spot.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Links with non-Latin Characters:</strong> The use of new scripts to register domains has created more opportunities for hackers. They can now use non-Latin characters to create homographic URLs, which look like Latin characters but come from a different alphabet. These URLs can deceive internet users into clicking on malicious links.</p>
